            <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
                world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don’t
                know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide… and only five
                made it out. Now we took an oath, that I’m breaking now. We said we’d say it was the snow that killed
                the other two, but it wasn’t. Nature is lethal but it doesn’t hold a candle to man.</p>

            <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of
                evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
                of darkness, for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike
                down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My
                brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>

            <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I’m not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you
                know how you can tell who the arch-villain’s going to be? He’s the exact opposite of the hero. And most
                times they’re friends, like you and me! I should’ve known way back when… You know why, David? Because of
                the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>

            <p>Your bones don’t break, mine do. That’s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
                mine. You don’t get sick, I do. That’s also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
                way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it
                may seem, we are connected, you and I. We’re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>
